    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> <a id="TOP">ALL ABOUT PIZZA</a></h1>
    <p>Pizza is an Italian dish consisting of a usually round, flattened base of
       leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often
       various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives,
       pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
       A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p>

       <h3><a id="1">ETYMOLOGY</a></h3>
       <p>The word "pizza" first appeared in a Latin text from the central
         Italian town of Gaeta, then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD;
          the text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop
          of Gaeta duodecim pizze ("twelve pizzas") every Christmas Day, and another
           twelve every Easter Sunday.</p>

        <h3><a id="2"> HISTORY </a></h3>
        <p>Foods similar to pizza have been made since the Neolithic Age.Records
          of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful
          can be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian
           soldiers of the Achaemenid Empire during the rule of Darius the Great baked
           flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields
          and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese.An early reference
          to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the Trojans
          would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII,
          Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked
          vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno.</p>

          <h3> <a id="3">PREPARATION</a></h3>
          <p>Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or as portion-size slices or pieces. Methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining
             with the dough and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid.
              There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.
Another form of uncooked pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in the store,
 then sold to customers to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores sell
fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to complete at home before baking in an oven.</p> <br>
          <h4><a id="4">Cooking</a></h4>
          <p>In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with stone bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven, or, in the case of more expensive restaurants, a wood or coal-fired brick oven. On deck ovens, pizza can be slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on the hot bricks or baked on a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum). Prior to use, a peel may be sprinkled with cornmeal to allow pizza to easily slide onto and off of it.</p>

<h4><a id="5">Crust</a></h4>
<p>The bottom of the pizza, called the "crust", may vary widely according to style, thin as in a typical hand-tossed Neapolitan pizza or thick as in a deep-dish Chicago-style. It is traditionally plain, but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese. The outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the cornicione.</p>

<h4><a id="6">Cheese</a></h4>
<p>Mozzarella is commonly used on pizza, with the highest quality buffalo mozzarella produced in the surroundings of Naples.</p>

<h3> <a id="7">VARIETIES</a> </h3>

<h4> <a id="8">Italy</a> </h4>
<p>Authentic Neapolitan pizza (pizza napoletana) is made with San Marzano tomatoes, grown on the volcanic plains south of Mount Vesuvius, and mozzarella di bufala Campana, made with milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio.</p>
<h4> <a id="9">United States</a> </h4>
<p>The first pizzeria in the U.S. was opened in New York City's Little Italy in 1905. Common toppings for pizza in the United States include anchovies, ground beef, chicken, ham, mushrooms,
  olives, onions, peppers, pepperoni, pineapple, salami, sausage, spinach, steak, and tomatoes. </p>
<h4> <a id="0">Argentina</a> </h4>
<p>Argentina, and more specifically Buenos Aires, received a massive Italian immigration at the turn of the 19th century. Immigrants from Naples and Genoa opened the first pizza bars, though over time Spanish residents came to own the majority of the pizza businesses.

Standard Argentine pizza has a thicker crust, called "media masa" (half dough) than traditional Italian style pizza and includes more cheese.</p>
